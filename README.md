####   Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) is a diagnostic technology for gastrointestinal tract pathology detection. It has emerged as an alternative to conventional endoscopy which could be distressing to the patient. However, the diagnosis process requires to view and analyze hundreds of frames extracted from WCE video. This makes the diagnosis tedious. For this purpose, researches related to the automatic detection of signs of gastrointestinal diseases have been boosted. 

#### 	In this project, we intent to design a pattern recognition system for detecting Multiple Bleeding Spots (MBS) using WCE video. The proposed system relies on the Deep Learning approach to accurately recognize multiple bleeding spots in the gastrointestinal tract. Specifically, the You Only Look Once (YOLO) Deep Learning models will be explored in this research.
